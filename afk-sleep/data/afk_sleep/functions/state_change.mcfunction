# The formula for getting the percentage as a number between 0 and 100 is this:
# (notAFK * relativePercentage) / totalPlayers

advancement revoke @s only afk_sleep:trigger_when_sleeping

# .notAFK could be stored directly into .playersSleepingPercentage, but it's useful
# for debugging to keep it separate so you can see the calculation.
