# TODO: Phantoms will no longer spawn, which means no membrane, which
# means no potions of slow falling. I don't think phantoms are a badly
# implemented mob, but they're badly designed in terms of incentives.
# Is there another way the phantoms could be integrated? Some way that
# players could summon them? (I'm thinking something like eating a
# suspicious stew, maybe the blindness one?)
