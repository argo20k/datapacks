# Documentation

Activity detection uses the player's head rotation to determine activity. If the
horizontal angle of the head changes, it is counted as activity.

## Overview

By default, if the head rotation stays the same for **3600** ticks, players are
tagged with `afk`, then the `#afk:away` function tag is executed. When the
player next rotates their head, the `#afk:back` tag is executed _before_ the
number of ticks the player has been inactive for is cleared.

The API documentation in the next section contains further information.

Below is a very simple datapack that kicks AFK players if they aren't
spectators.

**kick-afk-players/data/afk/tags/functions/away.json**

```json
{ "values": ["afk_kick:kick"] }
```

**kick-afk-players/data/afk_kick/functions/kick.mcfunction**

```mcfunction
execute if entity @s[gamemode=!spectator] run kick @s AFK
```

## API docs for add-ons

The public API of this data pack is stable, and intentionally quite small. The
statements below are the guarantees implied by the current version of the data
pack, with the normal backwards compatibility guarantees of semantic versioning:
minor versions may introduce new features, but will not introduce breaking
changes.

### Scoreboard tags

#### üè∑Ô∏è `afk`

This tag, when applied to players, indicates that said player is "away".

This tag is managed by this data pack, and should not be added to any players,
or removed from any players, by any external data pack or add-on.

The presence of this tag controls whether the function tags should be executed
as the player it is applied to. As players may end up removing this tag from
another player manually, functions registered to `afk:away` and `afk:back`
should be idempotent (state changes due to being called repeatedly should result
in the same output state).

### Scoreboard objectives

#### `afk`

Trigger scoreboard that allows players to manually become AFK, if enabled by a
server operator.

To enable a player, use the `scoreboard players enable` command:

```mcfunction
/scoreboard players enable @s afk
```

The scoreboard is then used with the trigger command:

```mcfunction
/trigger afk
```

This is not enabled for any players by default because it has the potential for
abuse, such as spamming chat messages with **AFK Message** or granting
invincibility with **AFK Immunity**

#### `afk.settings`

Any configuration for this datapack. New values may be introduced in the future.

This scoreboard is mutable but should not be used to store any external state.
Addons should maintain their own settings.

- **`.ticks`**
  - The number of ticks of inactivity it takes for a player to be counted as
    AFK.
  - This is set to **3600** by default, which is long enough to pee, but not
    long enough to poop.
  - `/scoreboard players set .ticks afk.settings NUMBER_OF_TICKS`

#### `afk.ticks`

The number of ticks that a player has been detected as inactive.

### Function tags

#### `afk:away`

- Called as the player that has gone AFK.
- This is guaranteed to happen after the player has been tagged as `afk` and
  their `afk.ticks` has reached the configured threshold.
- This is not guaranteed to be executed only once per player before `afk:back`
  is executed. Functions registered to this function tag should be idempotent.

#### `afk:back`

- Called as the player that has stopped being AFK.
- This is guaranteed to happen after the `afk` tag has been removed and their
  `afk.ticks` has been set to 0.
- This is not guaranteed to be executed only once per player after `afk:away` is
  executed. Functions registered to this function tag should be idempotent.
