# Documentation

You can use the AFK functionality by adding functions to the `#afk:away` and
`#afk:back` function tags. Functions in both tags are called as the player at
the player's position.

The example below is a very simple datapack that kicks AFK players if they
aren't specatating.

**kick-afk-players/data/afk/tags/functions/away.json**

```json
{ "values": ["afk_kick:kick"] }
```

**kick-afk-players/data/afk_kick/functions/kick.mcfunction**

```mcfunction
execute if entity @s[gamemode=!spectator] run kick @s AFK
```

## Details

Activity detection uses the player's head rotation to determine their activity.
This uses a quaternary search to determine the angle to a 5.625deg accuracy, which
is less accurate than using NBT, but is more performant.

## API docs for add-ons

The public API of this data pack is stable. The statements below are the
guarantees implied by the current version of the data pack, with the normal
backwards compatibility guarantees of semantic versioning.

### Scoreboard tags

#### `afk`

This tag, when applied to players, indicates that said player is "away".

This tag is managed by this data pack, and should not be added to any players,
or removed from any players, by any external data pack or add-on.

The presence of this tag controls whether the function tags should be executed
as the player it is applied to. As players may end up removing this tag from
another player manually, functions registered to `afk:away` and `afk:back`
should be idempotent (state changes due to being called repeatedly should result
in the same output state).

### Scoreboards

#### `afk.settings`

Any configuration for this datapack. New values may be introduced in the future.

This scoreboard is mutable but should not be used to store any external state.
Addons should maintain their own settings.

- **Known keys**
  - `.ticks`
    - The number of ticks it takes for a player to be counted as AFK.
    - This is set to **3600** by default.

#### `afk.ticks`

The number of ticks that a player has been detected as inactive.

---

### Function tags

#### `afk:away`

- Called as the player that has gone AFK.
- This is guaranteed to happen after the player has been tagged as `afk` and
  their `afk.ticks` has reached the configured threshold.
- This is not guaranteed to be executed only once per player before `afk:back`
  is executed. Functions registered to this function tag should be idempotent.

#### `afk:back`

- Called as the player that has stopped being AFK.
- This is guaranteed to happen after the `afk` tag has been removed and their
  `afk.ticks` has been set to 0.
- This is not guaranteed to be executed only once per player after `afk:away` is
  executed. Functions registered to this function tag should be idempotent.
