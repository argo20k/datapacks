You can use the AFK functionality by adding functions to the `#afk:away` and
`#afk:back` function tags. Functions in both tags are called as the player at
the player's position.

The example below is a very simple datapack that kicks AFK players if they
aren't specatating.

**kick-afk-players/data/afk/tags/functions/away.json**

```json
{ "values": ["afk_kick:kick"] }
```

**kick-afk-players/data/afk_kick/functions/kick.mcfunction**

```mcfunction
execute if entity @s[gamemode=!spectator] run kick @s AFK
```
