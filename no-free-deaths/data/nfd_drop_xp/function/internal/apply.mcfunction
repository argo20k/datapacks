# there isn't really a sane way to summon the XP orbs. While players do now store their last death location,
# making the XP spawn there would massively complicate the logic for something that almost nobody uses.
# However, it's important that this data pack doesn't do something very unexpected in that edge case,
# such as instantly giving the player that died their XP upon respawn.
